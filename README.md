# Ketch CMP template for Google Tag Manager

This is a Google consent mode template for GTM. It is customised to integrate with the [Ketch smart tag](https://github.com/ketch-com/ketch-tag#ketch-tag). It enables customers to control the GTM tag firing with respect to the user consent obtained through the Ketch customised consent experience.
